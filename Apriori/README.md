# Apriori with C++
--------------------------------
The apriori Algo is for mining the frequent item sets.  
Each line in the input file is a transaction, and each number is an item.  
The Algo mines the frequent items from the input file and writes it to the output file.  
You need to create the output file.  
In the output file, in each line there is a comma, the numbers before comma are frequent item sets and the number after that is the count of that itemset.  
In the example below, we have item 5 six times and we have 2 4 three times.  
Example:  
5,6  
2 4 , 3
